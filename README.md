## THE PROJECT IS WIP (WORK IN PROGRESS)

# SereneDB

SereneDB is an open-source project designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and search vector data in the browser using IndexedDB, localStorage, and in-memory caching. This database system is optimized for fast access to vector data while ensuring data integrity and synchronization across various storage mediums.

## Roadmap for SereneDB

### 1. Initial Setup
- Define the project requirements and scope for SereneDB.
- Set up the development environment.
- Outline data structure and schema for storing vectors in SereneDB using IndexedDB and localStorage.

### 2. Design Phase
- Design the data model for vectors in SereneDB.
- Define how vector data will be stored, loaded, and cached within SereneDB.
- Design the architecture, including data flow between IndexedDB, localStorage, and in-memory variables.

### 3. Storage and Caching Strategy
- Implement IndexedDB within SereneDB for persistent storage of vectors.
- Implement localStorage as a caching mechanism for SereneDB.
- Develop a strategy to load data into memory and keep the cache in sync within SereneDB.

### 4. Core Functionality Implementation
- Load vector data from IndexedDB into in-memory variables within SereneDB.
- Implement vector search operations directly on the in-memory data within SereneDB.
- Ensure cache updates using localStorage during vector operations in SereneDB.

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Handle abrupt breaks by ensuring data integrity within SereneDB.
- Implement fallback mechanisms for SereneDB if data retrieval or storage fails.
- Manage synchronization between in-memory data, IndexedDB, and localStorage in SereneDB.

### 6. Optimization
- Optimize vector search operations within SereneDB for performance.
- Implement efficient data loading and caching strategies in SereneDB.
- Minimize the overhead of synchronization between storage and in-memory operations in SereneDB.

### 7. Testing
- Unit test all SereneDB functions and operations.
- Test synchronization between IndexedDB, localStorage, and in-memory data within SereneDB.
- Ensure SereneDB handles large datasets effectively.

### 8. Documentation
- Document SereneDB's architecture, code, and usage.
- Provide guidelines for extending or modifying SereneDB's search functionality.

### 9. Deployment
- Prepare SereneDB for deployment, ensuring browser compatibility.
- Optimize SereneDB for performance on different browsers.
- Monitor for any issues post-deployment and iterate on SereneDB as needed.

## List of Required Operations for SereneDB

### 1. Data Storage and Retrieval
- Store vectors in IndexedDB via SereneDB.
- Retrieve vectors from IndexedDB into SereneDB’s in-memory variables.
- Cache vector data in localStorage through SereneDB.

### 2. Vector Search Operations
- Perform vector search directly on SereneDB's in-memory data.
- Return search results efficiently through SereneDB.

### 3. Cache Management
- Update the cache in localStorage during vector operations within SereneDB.
- Synchronize SereneDB’s in-memory data with localStorage and IndexedDB.

### 4. Error Handling
- Handle cases where data retrieval or storage fails within SereneDB.
- Ensure data integrity in case of abrupt application closures in SereneDB.

### 5. Data Loading and Unloading
- Load data into SereneDB’s memory at the start of operations.
- Unload data from SereneDB’s memory if not needed to free up resources.

## List of Functions for SereneDB and Their Purpose

### 1. `initializeSereneDB()`
- Set up SereneDB by initializing IndexedDB with the necessary object stores and indexes.

### 2. `loadDataFromSereneDB()`
- Load vector data from IndexedDB into SereneDB’s in-memory variable.

### 3. `saveDataToSereneDB(vectorData)`
- Store or update vector data in SereneDB's IndexedDB.

### 4. `loadCacheFromSereneDB()`
- Load cached data from localStorage into SereneDB’s in-memory variable.

### 5. `updateCacheInSereneDB()`
- Update localStorage with the latest in-memory vector data to keep the cache in SereneDB up-to-date.

### 6. `performSereneDBVectorSearch(queryVector)`
- Perform a vector search using SereneDB’s in-memory data and return the results.

### 7. `syncSereneDBCacheAndDatabase()`
- Synchronize SereneDB’s in-memory data, localStorage cache, and IndexedDB to ensure consistency.

### 8. `handleSereneDBAbruptClosure()`
- Ensure data integrity by saving in-memory data to localStorage in case of an abrupt closure in SereneDB.

### 9. `sereneDBErrorHandler(error)`
- A centralized function to handle errors during storage, retrieval, and search operations in SereneDB.

### 10. `clearSereneDBCache()`
- Clear localStorage cache when necessary, such as during a reset or to free up space in SereneDB.

### 11. `optimizeSereneDBSearchPerformance()`
- Apply optimizations to SereneDB’s vector search algorithm based on data size and query complexity.

### 12. `unloadSereneDBDataFromMemory()`
- Unload vector data from SereneDB’s in-memory storage when it is no longer needed to manage memory usage efficiently.
